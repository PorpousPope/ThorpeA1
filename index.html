 <h2>Personal Information</h2>
 <p>I am Thorpe Honeyman, student number s3897395. I was born in England in 2002 and moved to Australia in 2007. Both my parents are similarly English, and as such, I have grown up with a great fondness of my home country. I completed my full secondary education in 2020 at Mullauna College, while studying IT as a VET subject. Unfortunately, I am unuble to speak any language other than English, although I did spend the first few years at high school learning German. In my spare time I volunteer at a local scouting group, as a youth leader for cubs (8-11y/o) and I have done so for the past three years. I also sometime attend the local rover (18-26y/o) crew. If you would like to get in contact with me, you can via emailing s3897395@student.rmit.edu.au.</p>

 <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
 <p>I have been interested in IT since early high school when I completed some classes on programming. Before I started VCE, my high school stopped offering IT subjects and so I enrolled in a VET course to continue. This VET course helped further interest me in IT, and specifically in networking.</p>
 <p>I chose to attend RMIT as I was recommended on may occasions to study at university rather than TAFE, and while looking into which school offered IT courses, I learnt that RMIT has a great IT department.</p>
 <p>From this course I hope to learn more about how to construct computers, and the basic functions that they have. I also hope to learn a moderate amount of HTML.</p>

 <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
 <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51746428?type=standard#searchRequestToken=2afd8f4a-10fe-4e8c-9b53-c3eb71ed61a3">IT Systems Administrator and Network Specialist</a>
 <img src="networkingjob.JPG" width="150" height="230">
 <p>An IT systems administrator is in charge of a company’s computer network. They ensure the company’s systems are running correctly, create new users for when new employees join the company, and adjust the network’s settings to what the business wants. I find this job appealing as it is an extension of when knowledge I already have in IT.</p>
 <p>For this job, you need experience and qualifications based around creating and maintaining computer networks. This experience should be both with physical computers and operating systems, but also with virtual machines.</p>
 <p>While I may not have the same level of experience that this job expects, I have studied computer networking, and have experience in creating virtual networks, users and virtual machines. The only skill that they ask for that I don’t have any experience with is ticketing systems.</p>
 <p>To get the training and experience that I need for this sort of job, I plan to continue studying my Bachelor of IT, and once I have enough knowledge, I intend to attain a lower-level network support job, to get the real-world experience to be able to manage becoming a network administrator.</p>

 <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
 <h4>Myers-Briggs: ISFP-T Adventurer</h4>
 <h4>Learning style: Auditory</h4>
 <h4>Big Five Personality Test:</h4>
 <h4>Low Extroversion, Moderate Emotional Stability, Moderately High Agreeableness, Moderate Conscientiousness, Moderate Intellect/Imagination</h4>
 <p>These tests show that I am very observant of my surroundings, and that I show a lot of empathy towards others. They also show that I am good at finding solutions. The most important thing that these tests show is that, while I am not amazing in social situations, I do manage to get along with people, and work well with them.</p>
 <p>These result influence how I work in a team due to how I struggle to start talking to someone new, but once I get to know people, I am always capable of working with them, and working hard at whatever needs to be done.</p>
 <p>To form a team containing me, based on these tests, the best option is to use either people who I already know, allowing me to skip on the introversion. If this isn’t an option, forming a team early allows would allow me to get to know the team in my own time.</p>

 <h2>Project Idea</h2>
 <h4>Overview</h4>
 <p>My product is a website that is designed after the old cub, scout and venturer badge books, where leaders, parents and scouting members can go to reference the past badge system, and what each badge or activity corresponds to in the new badge system. This product s needed due to the unintuitive nature of the new system, and to assist in converting work scouting members have completed in the past into the new system.</p>
 <h4>Motivation</h4>
 <p>Recently scouting changed their badge system with the intent of making each level more interconnected. This change has been met with backlash from parents and scouting members due to the new system being unintuitive for young members to use themselves, requiring kids as young as 5 to demonstrate skills and teach their peers, whereas the old system gave simple dot point instructions on what was required to achieve badges, allowing scouts to plan and achieve badges independently. The system has similarly felt backlash from group leaders who, during the transitional period, need to take the past badge work of scouts, and convert all the tasks that have been completed to equivalent new system badges.</p>
 <h4>Description</h4>
 <p>My product is a website designed to help fix the issues with the new scouting badge system, and to help long-time scouting members become more accustomed to the new system and help make converting previously done work to the up-to-date format.</p>
 <p>The website would be designed to look like the original scouting record books, with separate sections for each branch of scouting. To allow for the different sections, the home page would be a display of the book covers for each level. Upon selecting a section, you would be given an index of all badge work within the original system, organised in the same order and in sections as in the original books. Upon selecting the intended page, you would be presented with an image of what the badge looks like, and the steps of how to achieve it, mirroring that of the original books. The page would also have notes along the right-hand side, referencing the new system’s badges, and what part of the new badges correlates to the old tasks. The pages will be designed after the original books to help anyone accustomed to the old system to transition into the new system. The idea of designing the pages after the original also helps with cross-referencing for anyone who has completed parts of their original books.</p>
 <p>To fund the creation of this website, I would contact Scouts Australia for possible funding. They would likely be willing to fund the creation of this website due to wanting to help reduce the amount of backlash from their controversial change.</p>
 <p>The website would probably only be noticeably expensive while being created, as I would likely need a small team to work on it over a numbers of weeks. As the website doesn’t introduce anything special, being merely a collection of, it would likely not need much bug fixing after it is released. It would probably only need changing in any fashion assuming that Scouts Australia chooses to alter the badge system even further in the future.</p>
 <p>While this website isn’t particularly complex by modern website standards, I would require quite a large amount of time spent on design to ensure that it is intuitive to use, and still keeps to the style of the original books. This website would also require large amounts of databases, to keep track of all the content in the books and what new sections they correlate with.</p>
 <p>This idea could be even further explored by having sections for the levels of scouting that didn’t originally have books, so that the equivalent badges in these levels would also get conversions. The website could also include a section for the new system, giving recommended ideas and activities to help parents and scouting members to understand what each badge requires them to do.</p>
 <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
 <p>To create this website, I would likely require a dedicated server to run from, to ensure that it could cope with all the people that would be using it. The website would also require the use of a html editing application to allow it to be created. This app could be something as simple as Notepad++ or could be an app entirely for html like HTML editor. The website would most likely require the use of a database application to either be referred to by the website itself, or in its creation, to ensure that there are no mistakes in what information is displayed on each web page. This app could be something like SQLite, or anything similar.</p>
 <h4>Skills Required</h4>
 <p>To create this project, I would need skills in website creation and user centred design knowledge to allow the website to be both functional and intuitive. I would also need skills in creating and managing a database to contain all relevant conversions. Probably one of the most important skill for this website is the understanding of both the old badge system as well as the new system as without this knowledge you would be unable to correctly give equivalent badge work between systems.</p>
 <h4>Outcome</h4>
 <p>My website will help with the current transition to the new badge system as it will allow leaders, parents and scouts to look through their respective records and quickly be able to convert past work into the new system. While this may seem like this website can only be useful while transitioning between the badge systems, I believe that it will likely also become helpful for leaders and scout in planning how they complete badgework. I believe that it may be that people choose the dot point style of the old system and use my website to convert it to the appropriate modern-day badges.</p>
